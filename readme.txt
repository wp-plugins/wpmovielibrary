== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this legal? =

Absolutely. Unlike most similar plugins, WPMovieLibrary uses TheMovieDB instead of IMDb due to the lack of proper official and legal API.

= Do I need an API key? =

No you don't. You can use your own TMDb API key for better results, but that is not required per se for WPMovieLibrary to work, the plugin can use its own API key if you don't provide one.

= How can I import metadata? =

Create a new Movie, input the movie title in search field below the content editor, hit "Search". If your search brings multiple results you will be presented a list of possible matches, else all fields will be automatically filled and you movie's poster automatically imported.

= How can I import my list of DVDs? =

Use the import tool: simply paste a list of titles, all your movies will be created instantly. Now you can import metadata one-by-one or group the search, and then import directly the movies or add it to the queue for later final import.
